# Readers Space

It is a very minimalistic dictionary web app. Just a searh bar and after enter the defination of the word will be shown.
During reading sometimes we got into defination searches and that leads to all sorts of distractions.
By design there is no hyperlinks or any other distractions. Just a search bar and a list of defination.
